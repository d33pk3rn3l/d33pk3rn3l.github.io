Welcome to the Space System Engineering digital garden! This repository summarizes the lecture Space System Engineering held at ETH Zurich by Prof. Dr. Thomas Zurbuchen, Dr. Simon Christian Stähler, and Dr. Florian Kehl. The lecture is part of the Master’s program in Space Systems.

This digital garden is a network of interconnected ideas, notes, and summaries that capture the essence of the lecture, primarily based on the book Space Mission Engineering: The New SMAD by James R. Wertz and Wiley J. Larson.
