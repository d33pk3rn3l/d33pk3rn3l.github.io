Our civilization is digital. Our laws, our culture, our science: it's all data. But it's all stored on a single, fragile planet. Terrestrial [data embassies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_embassy) are a start, but they won't survive a global catastrophe.

## The Solution: A Planetary Data Network

**The Haven** is a global, multi-layered data network in space, designed to ensure our knowledge and systems survive any terrestrial disaster.

* **LEO Satellites:** A "hot" network for live government operations.
* **GEO Satellites:** A "warm" hub for stable, long-term continuity.
* **Lunar Archive:** A "cold" vault on the Moon for a nation's most vital data.
* **'Eternity' Probes:** An "ultra-cold" archive sent to the stars to preserve our legacy for millennia.

## The Swiss Key: Neutrality as a Service

This global commons needs a neutral guardian. Switzerland provides the **diplomatic and legal key**.

* It spearheads the **international treaty** to create **The Haven**.
* It hosts the **Swiss Neutrality Vault**, the back-up, trusted ground station that provides secure access to the entire space network, protected by Swiss and international law.

**The Haven** is a vision for planetary resilience, initiated by Swiss neutrality, for the benefit of all humanity.

> [Leon](https://github.com/leon-thomm) & myself built a small prototype for showing the concept off. It consists of a **[Simulation](https://leon-thomm.github.io/helvetica-haven/simulation/)** and a **[Console](https://leon-thomm.github.io/helvetica-haven/console/)** that explains the idea. This was framed for the [Swissnex Call "Imagining Planetary Diplomacy"](https://swissnex.org/our-impact/planet/imagining-planetary-diplomacy/).

This post is part of an [architecture concept](https://github.com/d33pk3rn3l/the-haven) my brain tingles me with. **The Haven** is a fictional concept, and could be extended to surpass nationality and provide the spark for a global civilization that is not bound by statehood, but by shared knowledge and culture. I don't know if the world is ready for it yet.
